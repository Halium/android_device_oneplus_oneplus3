description "Device hacks - create /etc/acdbdata symlink"
author "Ratchanan Srirattanamet <ratchanan@ubports.com>"

# This device has a problem with the Audio HAL's component that cause it to
# always look for the ACDB data in /etc/acdbdata rather than in the /system
# partition. The data is required for voice call volume to work properly.
# Thus, a symlink is needed.
